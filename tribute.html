    <h4 id="headline">Here's a summary of Mary Slessor's life:</h3>
    <p class="summary">Born December 2, 1848 in Gilcomston, Aberdeen, Scotland, MARY Mitchell Slessor, a five foot, 
        red haired Scottish Missionary who pioneered her way into the jungles of Africa was undoubtedly 
        one of the most outstanding missionaries who made tremendous contributions to evangelism, charity work,
        educational and healthcare services and publicized Nigeria in the map of the world. She faced many challenges
        living with the villagers, and at times, even had to be a peacemaker between tribesmen. Her work and strong personality 
        allowed her to be trusted and accepted by the locals while spreading Christianity in Nigeria, promoting women’s rights, 
        rescuing unwanted children and protecting native children. She died on 13 January, 1915 (aged 66) at Use Ikot Oku, Calabar, Nigeria. 
        Beyond contribution to knowledge, this brief work is a legacy of Mary Mitchell Slessor’s contributions to the evangelization of Nigeria
        and Church History.</p>
